# 🌊 Escape Tsunami For Brainrots — Helper Script (Beta)

Open source helper script for **Escape Tsunami For Brainrots**.  
Designed to improve gameplay comfort and provide useful features where possible.

Because the map is protected by security settings, some features (such as **God Mode**) are currently limited or run in development mode.  
Instead, this script focuses on alternative helpers that still provide value to the player.
